    <p>
        &#39;&#39;How might we help college students do laundry, especially when they use the shared laundry room, in a more efficient and satisfying way&#63;&#39;&#39;
    </p>
    <h3>The Result</h3>
    <p>
        LaundroPod is <b>a system that shows users of laundry machine availability</b> with lights in a business-card-sized device. We envisioned it to have the ability to <b>retrofit to any laundry machines</b>, allowing laundry providers to upgrade outdated ones without investing too much.

        Our Process

    <p>
        We followed the double diamond product development process, which allows us to explore and gather inspiration in a bigger space and be reasonable in every decision.

    <h2>Start with Narrowing Down by Analyzing Trends</h2>
    <p>
        The problem statement contains three concepts: "Shared laundry", "college students", and "efficient and satisfying". we opened up our scope to each of these concepts to look for significant trends that can potential impact the problem space. 
        
        Three of the trends contributed most to the identification of potential product opportunity and narrowed the problem down: 
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
        <b>Trend One: </b><a href = "https://www.statista.com/statistics/798353/us-smart-home-sales/" target = "_blank">Growing adoption</a> of <a href = "https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20190603005509/en/Global-Dry-Cleaning-Laundry-Services-Market-worth-USD" target = "_blank">smart laundry devices</a> and growing awareness of <a href = "https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?date=today%205-y&geo=US&q=IoT" target = "_blank">IoT</a>, <a href = "https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?date=today%205-y&geo=US&q=smart%20home" target = "_blank">smart homes</a>, and <a href = "https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?date=today%205-y&geo=US&q=connected%20devices" target = "_blank">connected devices</a>. 
        </li>

        <li>
        <b>Trend Two: </b>While universities' brand image consists words like “innovative” and “cutting-edge”, <a href = "https://medium.com/@todd_99843/why-laundry-matters-on-campus-b0beb739c7ba" target = "_blank">the laundry facilities still feels like the 90s.</a></li>
       
        <li>
        There is a growing trend of smart devices, including smart laundry machines in the market</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        The trends contribute to narrowing down the problem space to University laundry room. Now we know there is a market, how do we make sure the product is useful, usable, and desirable?

    <h2>Undertanding Target Users with Empathy</h2>
    <p>
        To further understand how students interact with their laundry facilities, I went to dormatory laundry room to observe what they do and talked to some of them on-site. 
    </p>
    <p>
<!--
        These are some of the things they said: (We found the majority of complaints are around laundry preparation stage, which contains four steps&#58; garment sorting, carrying, checking availability, and making payments. Students found these processes mechanical, redundant, boring, and sometimes irritating. )
    </p>
    <p>
        One interviewee mentioned himself having a mentality of playing lottery when checking if there is spare machines. Making the experience playful was the only way to cope with the frustration of founding no available machines after walking long distances with about 3 kg &#40;6.6 lbs&#41; of garments. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Another student had to use a dedicated laundry card for payment, and as a result, she often found herself spending ten minutes looking for it before starting laundry. Besides, there is only one recharging station in the whole building and it only takes cash. 
    </p>

        <!--of qoutes-->

    <p>
        We combined the information from observation and interview to a job-to-be-done map:

    <h3>Key Insights</h3>
    <ul>
        <li></li>

    </ul>
    
    <p>
        Having the insights empowered us to be more empathetic towards how they interact with the laundry facilities. Keeping these in mind, we proceed to identify product opportunity gap and derive product requirements. 
    </p>
    
</div>
    
<!--1 POG and PR--><div class = "stagediv">
    <h2>Specifying Product Opportunity Gap and Product Requirement</h2>
    <p>
        Taking market trends and research insights as fundations, the team went through a process of proposing ## potential product opportunity gaps and downselecting with clustering and combining. By the end of the process, we end up with one Super Product Opportunity Gap&#58;
    </p>
    <p id = emphasize style = "margin: 10px auto; width: 80%;">
        How might we create a product or service that makes laundry preparation stage more efficient for students, considering the low budget of universities and imerging trend of smart devices?
        <br><br>
    </p>
        
    
    <img src = "images/ideation.png">
    
    <p>
        We envisioned that the potential solutions must require less time devoted than the current system. It must be reasonably priced and should be an upgrade to the current laundry system instead of a revolutionary change. The solution should take minimal time to set up and to use, and at the same time, should not be a distraction. Following these product requirements, concepts were proposed to improve experience in one or more steps during laundry preparation.

    <h2>Finding a Potential Solution&#58; Ideation and Conceptualization</h2>
    <p>
        We conducted <a>ideation methods</a> including Crazy8, Brainwriting, Bad Ideas, and narrowed down concepts from over twenty to four major ones. 
    </p>
    <p>
        After evaluating each major concept based on time constraint, technical feasibility, price, preliminary user feedback and a closer analysis of product requirements and opportunity gap, we selected LaundroPod as the leading concept.

        LaundroPod is a system that shows users of laundry machine availability with lights in a business-card-sized device. We envisioned it to have the ability to retrofit to any laundry machines, allowing laundry providers to upgrade outdated ones without investing into new ones. 
    </p>
    <p>
        For the laundry room end, there will be weight, vibration, and current sensors to detect whether the machine is available or not. The data will be collected and transmitted to each individual device with wifi network. 
    </p>
    <p>
        The user-end device shows availability with lights when being pressed. The device comes with a sticker and a detachable clip, enabling it to stick to any surfaces or clip onto soft laundry baskets. The ten LEDs are divided into two groups: The blue ones indicates how many washer are available and the yellow ones for dryers. Five LEDs lit indicates five or more machines are available. The green LED ring on the back signals the device in active, incase none of LED is lit. 
    </p>
    <img src = "images/context_crop.png">
    <p>
         we kept the interaction simple and minimized the effort required on the user’s part to find out the availability of the machines. With the device active only when users press the button, it avoids being intrusive and annoying.
